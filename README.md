# 11ty docs skeleton

This project contains an 11ty skeleton with a few key features that documentation sites commonly need. It is **not** a theme - there is as little styling as possible while still keeping it readable. It should be thought of as a collection of utility features / ways to solve docs problems, which you can copy or build a theme on top of.

> **Note:** this project uses Nunjucks templating language. It may be possible to use others, but it hasn't been tested with anything else. Some of the features rely on Nunjucks functionality, such as `include` for content reuse.
