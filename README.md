# 11ty docs skeleton

This project contains an 11ty skeleton with a few key features that documentation sites commonly need.

> **Note:** this project uses Nunjucks templating language. It may be possible to use others, but it hasn't been tested with anything else. Some of the features rely on Nunjucks functionality, such as `include` for content reuse.
